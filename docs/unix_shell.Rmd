# The Unix Shell: A fundamental tool for bioinformatics

Outline:
+ What is the Unix shell? (What's Unix? What's a shell?)
+ Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL)
+ Why do we need to know this?
+ Interacting with the shell
+ Moving in and viewing your filesystem
+ Files (create, edit, delete)
+ Parsing (search and bulk edit files - read, search, sort, and rearrange files)


## What is the Unix Shell?

The shell provides an environment to interact with your computer on a more fundamental level than we are used to. It does this by implementing a simple "language" that we can learn to communicate with our machines through a command-line interface.

The command-line runs a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop operation that is the core of everything we do there. This is essentially what the RStudio Console window does for us in the context of R.

The command-line looks something like this:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
username@machine /path/to/where/you/are $
```
